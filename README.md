Our 3D Image Replica: For our Aframe project, we made a 3D replica of "Wheatfield with Crows" by Vincent Van Gogh. You can refer to the original 2D image below. If you would like to see the site, please check out the link on the GitHub Repo's README.md.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Dr. Bolter has given us an extension for the Aframe Project. We are allowed to work on this assignment until Thursday, October 6th because one of our team members had some challenges arise in their personal life. If you're a TA grading this project, you can verify this by asking Dr. Bolter. Although we submitted this assignment on time, we continued working on it until the new deadline (which you can see from the GitHub repo). If you're seeing this assignment before October 6th, please grade our assignment until after the new deadline has passed.
