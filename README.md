## Project Summary

For our project, we were required to build a 3D environment based off a 2D piece of media. Using this as a baseline, we decided to build a 3D image replica of Vincent Willem van Gogh's *Wheatfield with Crows* using A-Frame. An original image of the 2D drawing is attached below and an image of the 3D replica for the drawing it attached below that.
